To specify a comma separated list of environment variables specifically for map or reduce tasks, use the mapreduce.map.env or mapreduce.reduce.env properties. To define environment variables individually for map or reduce tasks, you can specify multiple properties of the form mapreduce.map.env.VARNAME or mapreduce.reduce.env.VARNAME, where VARNAME is the name of the environment variable.

This is not an additive property. You must preserve the original value if you want your map and reduce tasks to have access to native libraries (compression, etc). When this value is empty, the command to set execution environment will be OS dependent: For linux, use LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HADOOP_COMMON_HOME/lib/native. For windows, use PATH = %PATH%;%HADOOP_COMMON_HOME%\\bin. To define environment variables individually, you can specify multiple properties of the form mapreduce.admin.user.env.VARNAME, where VARNAME is the name of the environment variable.

If set to '*', it allows all users/groups to modify this job. If set to ' '(i.e. space), it allows none. This configuration is used to guard all the modifications with respect to this job and takes care of all the following operations: o killing this job o killing a task of this job, failing a task of this job o setting the priority of this job Each of these operations are also protected by the per-queue level ACL "acl-administer-jobs" configured via mapred-queues.xml. So a caller should have the authorization to satisfy either the queue-level ACL or the job-level ACL. Irrespective of this ACL configuration, (a) job-owner, (b) the user who started the cluster, (c) members of an admin configured supergroup configured via mapreduce.cluster.permissions.supergroup and (d) queue administrators of the queue to which this job was submitted to configured via acl-administer-jobs for the specific queue in mapred-queues.xml can do all the modification operations on a job.

If a job generates many files to commit then the commitJob method call at the end of the job can take minutes. the commit is single-threaded and waits until all tasks have completed before commencing. algorithm version 2 will change the behavior of commitTask, recoverTask, and commitJob. 1. commitTask will rename all files in $joboutput/_temporary/$appAttemptID/_temporary/$taskAttemptID/ to $joboutput/ 2. recoverTask actually doesn't require to do anything, but for upgrade from version 1 to version 2 case, it will check if there are any files in $joboutput/_temporary/($appAttemptID - 1)/$taskID/ and rename them to $joboutput/ 3. commitJob can simply delete $joboutput/_temporary and write $joboutput/_SUCCESS This algorithm will reduce the output commit time for large jobs by having the tasks commit directly to the final output directory as they were completing and commitJob had very little to do. |

If set, the framework archive will automatically be distributed along with the job, and this path would normally reside in a public location in an HDFS filesystem. As with distributed cache files, this can be a URL with a fragment specifying the alias to use for the archive name. For example, hdfs:/mapred/framework/hadoop-mapreduce-2.1.1.tar.gz#mrframework would alias the localized archive as "mrframework". Note that mapreduce.application.classpath must include the appropriate classpath for the specified framework. The base name of the archive, or alias of the archive if an alias is used, must appear in the specified classpath. |

The system classes are a comma-separated list of patterns that indicate whether to load a class from the system classpath, instead from the user-supplied JARs, when mapreduce.job.classloader is enabled. A positive pattern is defined as: 1. A single class name 'C' that matches 'C' and transitively all nested classes 'C$*' defined in C; 2. A package name ending with a '.' (e.g., "com.example.") that matches all classes from that package. A negative pattern is defined by a '-' in front of a positive pattern (e.g., "-com.example."). A class is considered a system class if and only if it matches one of the positive patterns and none of the negative ones. More formally: A class is a member of the inclusion set I if it matches one of the positive patterns. A class is a member of the exclusion set E if it matches one of the negative patterns. The set of system classes S = I \ E. |

If this value is empty or nonpositive then the cache reverts to using the property mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedjobs.cache.size as a job cache size. Two recommendations for the mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size property: 1) For every 100k of cache size, set the heap size of the Job History Server to 1.2GB. For example, mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size=500000, heap size=6GB. 2) Make sure that the cache size is larger than the number of tasks required for the largest job run on the cluster. It might be a good idea to set the value slightly higher (say, 20%) in order to allow for job size growth. |
