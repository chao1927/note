The default calculator is ReservedSpaceCalculatorAbsolute which will use dfs.datanode.du.reserved for a static reserved number of bytes. ReservedSpaceCalculatorPercentage will use dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct to calculate the reserved number of bytes based on the size of the storage. ReservedSpaceCalculatorConservative and ReservedSpaceCalculatorAggressive will use their combination, Conservative will use maximum, Aggressive minimum. For more details see ReservedSpaceCalculator. |

Always leave this much space free for non dfs use. Specific storage type based reservation is also supported. The property can be followed with corresponding storage types ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage. For example, reserved space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property 'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured then dfs.datanode.du.reserved will be used. Note: In case of using tune2fs to set reserved-blocks-percentage, or other filesystem tools, then you can possibly run into out of disk errors because hadoop will not check those external tool configurations. |

Read dfs.datanode.du.reserved.calculator to see when this takes effect. The actual number of bytes reserved will be calculated by using the total capacity of the data directory in question. Specific storage type based reservation is also supported. The property can be followed with corresponding storage types ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage. For example, reserved percentage space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property 'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured then dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct will be used. |

As a result, the number of datanodes in the pipeline is decreased. The feature is to add new datanodes to the pipeline. This is a site-wide property to enable/disable the feature. When the cluster size is extremely small, e.g. 3 nodes or less, cluster administrators may want to set the policy to NEVER in the default configuration file or disable this feature.

Suppose the datanode replacement fails. false: An exception should be thrown so that the write will fail. true : The write should be resumed with the remaining datandoes.

The limit is taken per thread, not in aggregate, e.g. setting a limit of 100ms for 4 compiler threads will result in each thread being limited to 100ms, not 25ms. Note that the throttle does not interrupt the report compiler threads, so the actual running time of the threads per second will typically be somewhat higher than the throttle limit, usually by no more than 20%. Setting this limit to 1000 disables compiler thread throttling. Only values between 1 and 1000 are valid. Setting an invalid value will result in the throttle being disabled and an error message being logged. 1000 is the default setting. |

The value must be greater than the value of dfs.heartbeat.interval. If this property is not defined, then the default behavior is to calculate the interval as 3x the value of dfs.heartbeat.interval. Note that normal heartbeat processing may cause the DataNode to postpone sending lifeline messages if they are not required. Under normal operations with speedy heartbeat processing, it is possible that no lifeline messages will need to be sent at all. This property has no effect if dfs.namenode.lifeline.rpc-address is not defined. |

For example, if dfs.namenode.handler.count is 100, and dfs.namenode.lifeline.handler.factor is 0.10, then the NameNode starts 100 * 0.10 = 10 threads for handling the lifeline RPC server. It is common to tune the value of dfs.namenode.handler.count as a function of the number of DataNodes in a cluster. Using this property allows for the lifeline RPC server handler threads to be tuned automatically without needing to touch a separate property. Lifeline message processing is lightweight, so it is expected to require many fewer threads than the main NameNode RPC server. This property is not used if dfs.namenode.lifeline.handler.count is defined, which sets an absolute thread count. This property has no effect if dfs.namenode.lifeline.rpc-address is not defined. |

If this property is defined, then it overrides the behavior of dfs.namenode.lifeline.handler.ratio. By default, it is not defined. This property has no effect if dfs.namenode.lifeline.rpc-address is not defined. |

When true, it will prefer the node where the client is running. When false, it will prefer a node in the same rack as the client. Setting to false avoids situations where entire copies of large files end up on a single node, thus creating hotspots. |

It does not translate directly to file's age, or the number of files kept, but to the number of transactions (here "edits" means transactions). One edit file may contain several transactions (edits). During checkpoint, NameNode will identify the total number of edits to retain as extra by checking the latest checkpoint transaction value, subtracted by the value of this property. Then, it scans edits files to identify the older ones that don't include the computed range of retained transactions that are to be kept around, and purges them subsequently. The retainment can be useful for audit purposes or for an HA setup where a remote Standby Node may have been offline for some time and need to have a longer backlog of retained edits in order to start again. Typically each edit is on the order of a few hundred bytes, so the default of 1 million edits should be on the order of hundreds of MBs or low GBs. NOTE: Fewer extra edits may be retained than value specified for this setting if doing so would mean that more segments would be retained than the number configured by dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained. |

In this case, the DataNode may be configured to automatically purge all data from the buffer cache after it is delivered to the client. This behavior is automatically disabled for workloads which read only short sections of a block (e.g HBase random-IO workloads).

This differs from the usual OS policy which may wait for up to 30 seconds before triggering writeback. This may improve performance for some workloads by smoothing the IO profile for data written to disk. If the Hadoop native libraries are not available, this configuration has no effect. |

The stale interval cannot be too small since otherwise this may cause too frequent change of stale states. We thus set a minimum stale interval value (the default value is 3 times of heartbeat interval) and guarantee that the stale interval cannot be less than the minimum value.

This determines the percentage amount of block invalidations (deletes) to do over a single DN heartbeat deletion command. The final deletion count is determined by applying this percentage to the number of live nodes in the system.

This determines the total amount of block transfers to begin in parallel at a DN, for replication, when such a command list is being sent over a DN heartbeat by the NN. The actual number is obtained by multiplying this multiplier with the total number of live nodes in the cluster. The result number is the number of blocks to begin transfers immediately for, per DN heartbeat. This number can be any positive, non-zero integer. |

The TrustedChannelResolver is invoked on both client and server side. If the resolver indicates that the channel is trusted, then the data transfer will not be encrypted even if dfs.encrypt.data.transfer is set to true. The default implementation returns false indicating that the channel is not trusted. |
| dfs.data.transfer.protection                                 |                                                              | A comma-separated list of SASL protection values used for secured connections to the DataNode when reading or writing block data. Possible values are authentication, integrity and privacy. authentication means authentication only and no integrity or privacy; integrity implies authentication and integrity are enabled; and privacy implies all of authentication, integrity and privacy are enabled. If dfs.encrypt.data.transfer is set to true, then it supersedes the setting for dfs.data.transfer.protection and enforces that all connections must use a specialized encrypted SASL handshake. This property is ignored for connections to a DataNode listening on a privileged port. In this case, it is assumed that the use of a privileged port establishes sufficient trust. |
| dfs.data.transfer.saslproperties.resolver.class              |                                                              | SaslPropertiesResolver used to resolve the QOP used for a connection to the DataNode when reading or writing block data. If not specified, the value of hadoop.security.saslproperties.resolver.class is used as the default value. |

If this optional address is set, it overrides only the hostname portion of dfs.journalnode.rpc-address. This is useful for making the JournalNode listen on all interfaces by setting it to 0.0.0.0. |
| dfs.journalnode.http-address                                 | 0.0.0.0:8480                                                 | The address and port the JournalNode HTTP server listens on. If the port is 0 then the server will start on a free port. |

If this optional address is set, it overrides only the hostname portion of dfs.journalnode.http-address. This is useful for making the JournalNode HTTP server listen on allinterfaces by setting it to 0.0.0.0. |

| dfs.journalnode.https-bind-host                              |                                                              | The actual address the HTTP server will bind to. If this optional address is set, it overrides only the hostname portion of dfs.journalnode.https-address. This is useful for making the JournalNode HTTP server listen on all interfaces by setting it to 0.0.0.0. |
| dfs.namenode.audit.loggers                                   | default                                                      | List of classes implementing audit loggers that will receive audit events. These should be implementations of org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.AuditLogger. The special value "default" can be used to reference the default audit logger, which uses the configured log system. Installing custom audit loggers may affect the performance and stability of the NameNode. Refer to the custom logger's documentation for more details. |
| dfs.datanode.available-space-volume-choosing-policy.balanced-space-threshold | 10737418240                                                  | Only used when the dfs.datanode.fsdataset.volume.choosing.policy is set to org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy. This setting controls how much DN volumes are allowed to differ in terms of bytes of free disk space before they are considered imbalanced. If the free space of all the volumes are within this range of each other, the volumes will be considered balanced and block assignments will be done on a pure round robin basis. |
| dfs.datanode.available-space-volume-choosing-policy.balanced-space-preference-fraction | 0.75f                                                        | Only used when the dfs.datanode.fsdataset.volume.choosing.policy is set to org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy. This setting controls what percentage of new block allocations will be sent to volumes with more available disk space than others. This setting should be in the range 0.0 - 1.0, though in practice 0.5 - 1.0, since there should be no reason to prefer that volumes with less available disk space receive more block allocations. |
| dfs.namenode.edits.noeditlogchannelflush                     | false                                                        | Specifies whether to flush edit log file channel. When set, expensive FileChannel#force calls are skipped and synchronous disk writes are enabled instead by opening the edit log file with RandomAccessFile("rws") flags. This can significantly improve the performance of edit log writes on the Windows platform. Note that the behavior of the "rws" flags is platform and hardware specific and might not provide the same level of guarantees as FileChannel#force. For example, the write will skip the disk-cache on SAS and SCSI devices while it might not on SATA devices. This is an expert level setting, change with caution. |
| dfs.client.cache.drop.behind.writes                          |                                                              | Just like dfs.datanode.drop.cache.behind.writes, this setting causes the page cache to be dropped behind HDFS writes, potentially freeing up more memory for other uses. Unlike dfs.datanode.drop.cache.behind.writes, this is a client-side setting rather than a setting for the entire datanode. If present, this setting will override the DataNode default. If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this configuration has no effect. |
| dfs.client.cache.drop.behind.reads                           |                                                              | Just like dfs.datanode.drop.cache.behind.reads, this setting causes the page cache to be dropped behind HDFS reads, potentially freeing up more memory for other uses. Unlike dfs.datanode.drop.cache.behind.reads, this is a client-side setting rather than a setting for the entire datanode. If present, this setting will override the DataNode default. If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this configuration has no effect. |
| dfs.client.cache.readahead                                   |                                                              | When using remote reads, this setting causes the datanode to read ahead in the block file using posix_fadvise, potentially decreasing I/O wait times. Unlike dfs.datanode.readahead.bytes, this is a client-side setting rather than a setting for the entire datanode. If present, this setting will override the DataNode default. When using local reads, this setting determines how much readahead we do in BlockReaderLocal. If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this configuration has no effect. |
| dfs.client.server-defaults.validity.period.ms                | 3600000                                                      | The amount of milliseconds after which cached server defaults are updated. By default this parameter is set to 1 hour. |
| dfs.namenode.enable.retrycache                               | true                                                         | This enables the retry cache on the namenode. Namenode tracks for non-idempotent requests the corresponding response. If a client retries the request, the response from the retry cache is sent. Such operations are tagged with annotation @AtMostOnce in namenode protocols. It is recommended that this flag be set to true. Setting it to false, will result in clients getting failure responses to retried request. This flag must be enabled in HA setup for transparent fail-overs. The entries in the cache have expiration time configurable using dfs.namenode.retrycache.expirytime.millis. |
| dfs.namenode.retrycache.expirytime.millis                    | 600000                                                       | The time for which retry cache entries are retained.         |
| dfs.namenode.retrycache.heap.percent                         | 0.03f                                                        | This parameter configures the heap size allocated for retry cache (excluding the response cached). This corresponds to approximately 4096 entries for every 64MB of namenode process java heap size. Assuming retry cache entry expiration time (configured using dfs.namenode.retrycache.expirytime.millis) of 10 minutes, this enables retry cache to support 7 operations per second sustained for 10 minutes. As the heap size is increased, the operation rate linearly increases. |
| dfs.client.mmap.enabled                                      | true                                                         | If this is set to false, the client won't attempt to perform memory-mapped reads. |
| dfs.client.mmap.cache.size                                   | 256                                                          | When zero-copy reads are used, the DFSClient keeps a cache of recently used memory mapped regions. This parameter controls the maximum number of entries that we will keep in that cache. The larger this number is, the more file descriptors we will potentially use for memory-mapped files. mmaped files also use virtual address space. You may need to increase your ulimit virtual address space limits before increasing the client mmap cache size. Note that you can still do zero-copy reads when this size is set to 0. |
| dfs.client.mmap.cache.timeout.ms                             | 3600000                                                      | The minimum length of time that we will keep an mmap entry in the cache between uses. If an entry is in the cache longer than this, and nobody uses it, it will be removed by a background thread. |
| dfs.client.mmap.retry.timeout.ms                             | 300000                                                       | The minimum amount of time that we will wait before retrying a failed mmap operation. |
| dfs.client.short.circuit.replica.stale.threshold.ms          | 1800000                                                      | The maximum amount of time that we will consider a short-circuit replica to be valid, if there is no communication from the DataNode. After this time has elapsed, we will re-fetch the short-circuit replica even if it is in the cache. |
| dfs.namenode.caching.enabled                                 | true                                                         | Set to true to enable block caching. This flag enables the NameNode to maintain a mapping of cached blocks to DataNodes via processing DataNode cache reports. Based on these reports and addition and removal of caching directives, the NameNode will schedule caching and uncaching work. |
| dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.block.map.allocation.percent   | 0.25                                                         | The percentage of the Java heap which we will allocate to the cached blocks map. The cached blocks map is a hash map which uses chained hashing. Smaller maps may be accessed more slowly if the number of cached blocks is large; larger maps will consume more memory. |
| dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory                               | 0                                                            | The amount of memory in bytes to use for caching of block replicas in memory on the datanode. The datanode's maximum locked memory soft ulimit (RLIMIT_MEMLOCK) must be set to at least this value, else the datanode will abort on startup. By default, this parameter is set to 0, which disables in-memory caching. If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this configuration has no effect. |
| dfs.namenode.list.cache.directives.num.responses             | 100                                                          | This value controls the number of cache directives that the NameNode will send over the wire in response to a listDirectives RPC. |
| dfs.namenode.list.cache.pools.num.responses                  | 100                                                          | This value controls the number of cache pools that the NameNode will send over the wire in response to a listPools RPC. |
| dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.refresh.interval.ms            | 30000                                                        | The amount of milliseconds between subsequent path cache rescans. Path cache rescans are when we calculate which blocks should be cached, and on what datanodes. By default, this parameter is set to 30 seconds. |
| dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.retry.interval.ms              | 30000                                                        | When the NameNode needs to uncache something that is cached, or cache something that is not cached, it must direct the DataNodes to do so by sending a DNA_CACHE or DNA_UNCACHE command in response to a DataNode heartbeat. This parameter controls how frequently the NameNode will resend these commands. |
| dfs.datanode.fsdatasetcache.max.threads.per.volume           | 4                                                            | The maximum number of threads per volume to use for caching new data on the datanode. These threads consume both I/O and CPU. This can affect normal datanode operations. |
| dfs.cachereport.intervalMsec                                 | 10000                                                        | Determines cache reporting interval in milliseconds. After this amount of time, the DataNode sends a full report of its cache state to the NameNode. The NameNode uses the cache report to update its map of cached blocks to DataNode locations. This configuration has no effect if in-memory caching has been disabled by setting dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory to 0 (which is the default). If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this configuration has no effect. |
| dfs.namenode.edit.log.autoroll.multiplier.threshold          | 0.5                                                          | Determines when an active namenode will roll its own edit log. The actual threshold (in number of edits) is determined by multiplying this value by dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns. This prevents extremely large edit files from accumulating on the active namenode, which can cause timeouts during namenode startup and pose an administrative hassle. This behavior is intended as a failsafe for when the standby or secondary namenode fail to roll the edit log by the normal checkpoint threshold. |
| dfs.namenode.edit.log.autoroll.check.interval.ms             | 300000                                                       | How often an active namenode will check if it needs to roll its edit log, in milliseconds. |

This prevents a WebHDFS client from hanging if the server hostname is misconfigured, or the server does not response before the timeout expires. Value is followed by a unit specifier: ns, us, ms, s, m, h, d for nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days respectively. Values should provide units, but milliseconds are assumed. |
| dfs.webhdfs.socket.read-timeout                              | 60s                                                          | Socket timeout for reading data from WebHDFS servers. This prevents a WebHDFS client from hanging if the server stops sending data. Value is followed by a unit specifier: ns, us, ms, s, m, h, d for nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days respectively. Values should provide units, but milliseconds are assumed. |

Clients that share a context share a socket cache and short-circuit cache, among other things. You should only change this if you don't want to share with another set of threads. |
| dfs.client.read.shortcircuit                                 | false                                                        | This configuration parameter turns on short-circuit local reads. |

This may affect TCP connection throughput. If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system. The default value is 0. |
| dfs.domain.socket.path                                       |                                                              | Optional. This is a path to a UNIX domain socket that will be used for communication between the DataNode and local HDFS clients. If the string "_PORT" is present in this path, it will be replaced by the TCP port of the DataNode. |
| dfs.domain.socket.disable.interval.seconds                   | 600                                                          | The interval that a DataNode is disabled for future Short-Circuit Reads, after an error happens during a Short-Circuit Read. Setting this to 0 will not disable Short-Circuit Reads at all after errors happen. Negative values are invalid. |
| dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.skip.checksum                   | false                                                        | If this configuration parameter is set, short-circuit local reads will skip checksums. This is normally not recommended, but it may be useful for special setups. You might consider using this if you are doing your own checksumming outside of HDFS. |
| dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.size              | 256                                                          | The DFSClient maintains a cache of recently opened file descriptors. This parameter controls the maximum number of file descriptors in the cache. Setting this higher will use more file descriptors, but potentially provide better performance on workloads involving lots of seeks. |

| dfs.webhdfs.rest-csrf.enabled                                | false                                                        | If true, then enables WebHDFS protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF). The WebHDFS client also uses this property to determine whether or not it needs to send the custom CSRF prevention header in its HTTP requests. |
| dfs.webhdfs.rest-csrf.custom-header                          | X-XSRF-HEADER                                                | The name of a custom header that HTTP requests must send when protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is enabled for WebHDFS by setting dfs.webhdfs.rest-csrf.enabled to true. The WebHDFS client also uses this property to determine whether or not it needs to send the custom CSRF prevention header in its HTTP requests. |

The WebHDFS client also uses this property to determine whether or not it needs to send the custom CSRF prevention header in its HTTP requests. |
| dfs.webhdfs.rest-csrf.browser-useragents-regex               | ^Mozilla.*,^Opera.*                                          | A comma-separated list of regular expressions used to match against an HTTP request's User-Agent header when protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is enabled for WebHDFS by setting dfs.webhdfs.reset-csrf.enabled to true. If the incoming User-Agent matches any of these regular expressions, then the request is considered to be sent by a browser, and therefore CSRF prevention is enforced. If the request's User-Agent does not match any of these regular expressions, then the request is considered to be sent by something other than a browser, such as scripted automation. In this case, CSRF is not a potential attack vector, so the prevention is not enforced. This helps achieve backwards-compatibility with existing automation that has not been updated to send the CSRF prevention header. |

This is typically set to balancer/_HOST@REALM.TLD. The Balancer will substitute _HOST with its own fully qualified hostname at startup. The _HOST placeholder allows using the same configuration setting on different servers. Keytab based login can be enabled with dfs.balancer.keytab.enabled. |

If this is set greater than 0, Balancer will stop waiting for a block move completion after this time. In typical clusters, a 3 to 5 minute timeout is reasonable. If timeout happens to a large proportion of block moves, this needs to be increased. It could also be that too much work is dispatched and many nodes are constantly exceeding the bandwidth limit as a result. In that case, other balancer parameters might need to be adjusted.

BlockPlacementPolicyWithNodeGroup places block replicas on environment with node-group layer. BlockPlacementPolicyRackFaultTolerant places the replicas to more racks. BlockPlacementPolicyWithUpgradeDomain places block replicas that honors upgrade domain policy. The details of placing replicas are documented in the javadoc of the corresponding policy classes. The default policy is BlockPlacementPolicyDefault, and the corresponding class is org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.blockmanagement.BlockPlacementPolicyDefault. |

In the case of HA/Federation where multiple namenodes exist, and if the Namenode is configured to run the aliasmap server (dfs.provided.aliasmap.inmemory.enabled is set to true), the name service id is added to the name, e.g., dfs.provided.aliasmap.inmemory.rpc.address.EXAMPLENAMESERVICE. The value of this property will take the form of host:rpc-port. |
| dfs.provided.aliasmap.inmemory.rpc.bind-host                 |                                                              | The actual address the in-memory aliasmap server will bind to. If this optional address is set, it overrides the hostname portion of dfs.provided.aliasmap.inmemory.rpc.address. This is useful for making the name node listen on all interfaces by setting it to 0.0.0.0. |

This setting supports multiple time unit suffixes as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval. If no suffix is specified then milliseconds is assumed. |
| dfs.datanode.disk.check.timeout                              | 10m                                                          | Maximum allowed time for a disk check to complete during DataNode startup. If the check does not complete within this time interval then the disk is declared as failed. This setting supports multiple time unit suffixes as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval. If no suffix is specified then milliseconds is assumed. |

The encrypted QOP will be used by DataNode as target QOP, overwriting DataNode configuration. This ensures DataNode will use exactly the same QOP NameNode and client has already agreed on. |
| dfs.encrypt.data.overwrite.downstream.derived.qop            | false                                                        | A boolean specifies whether DN should overwrite the downstream QOP in a write pipeline. This is used in the case where client talks to first DN with a QOP, but inter-DN communication needs to be using a different QOP. If set to false, the default behaviour is that inter-DN communication will use the same QOP as client-DN connection. |
| dfs.encrypt.data.overwrite.downstream.new.qop                |                                                              | When dfs.datanode.overwrite.downstream.derived.qop is set to true, this configuration specifies the new QOP to be used to overwrite inter-DN QOP. |
